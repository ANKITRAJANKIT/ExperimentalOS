# Experimental Operating System

## Overview
The **Experimental Operating System** is a custom-designed OS developed to run on an architecture simulator. This project aims to implement core operating system functionalities to understand and explore various OS concepts in a controlled environment.

## Features
- **Core Operating System Functionalities**: Implemented fundamental OS features that are essential for managing hardware and software resources.
- **Bootstrap Loader**: Created a bootstrap loader that initializes the OS and prepares the system for operation.
- **Round-Robin Scheduler**: Developed a round-robin scheduling algorithm to manage process execution efficiently.
- **Timer Interrupts**: Handled timer interrupts to facilitate process switching and time management.
- **Kernel Stack Management**: Managed the kernel stack for process execution and context switching.
- **Boot Modules**: Implemented boot modules that facilitate system startup and configuration.
- **Process Management**: Enabled process creation, termination, and synchronization, ensuring smooth execution of concurrent processes.
- **Console I/O**: Managed console input/output operations with disk interrupt handling and exception management.
- **File System Operations**: Built essential file system operations including file creation, deletion, read, and write.
- **Semaphores**: Implemented semaphores for process synchronization, ensuring safe access to shared resources.
